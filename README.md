## Overview of Project
### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to help audit votes in a precinct in Colorado. Itâ€™s being done by Python to efficiently count total votes, votes per candidate and percentage of votes each candidate has in an election. The code will automate all of this so it not only used for the current election being worked on but all other types of elections in the future.

## Election-Audit Summary

This script can not only work for the current election that the script was made for but others as well. The script is not set to any specific data so it can adapt to the voting data sets or information in upcoming elections. There will have to be small changes like which file to load into the script. As well as which rows it needs to iterate through to find certain variables.
